The idea is to combine the slash command and incoming webhooks Slack 
integrations.  To provide the "glue" between these integrations, 
the app needs to be hosted somewhere.  I use Heroku.  To set it up 
though first add the Incoming Webhooks integration in Slack, and make
a note of your Webhook URL.

To set up & to deploy from a fresh checkout of master to Heroku:

heroku create
git push heroku master
heroku ps:scale web=1
heroku ps
heroku config:set marvelPublicKey=SET_TO_YOUR_PUBLIC_MARVEL_API_KEY
heroku config:set marvelPrivateKey=SET_TO_YOUR_PRIVATE_MARVEL_API_KEY
heroku config:set slackWebHookURL=SET_TO_YOUR_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL

Once the heroku app is running (test it out by going to 
<yourHerokuURL>/marvel/Wolverine), add the slash & incoming webhooks
integrations in Slack.

For the slash command integration, use:

/marvel

as the command, and 

<yourHerokuURL>/test

as the URL for the slash integration.  Also add:

[character]

As the usage hint.
