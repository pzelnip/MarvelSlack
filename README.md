# Marvel Slack Bot

A silly little hack to support the ability in a Slack chatroom to do:

```
  /marvel <character>
```

And have it spit out cool info about a Marvel comic character

Edit: this is largely deprecated, as I've written a hubot script for doing the same: https://github.com/pzelnip/mySlackHubot/blob/master/scripts/marvel.coffee
